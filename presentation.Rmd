# Introduction

## Cocktail-party problem (Cherry, 1953)

How do we recognize what one person is saying when others are speaking at the same time?

When everyone at a well-attended party talks at the same level, the speech of the attended talker at a distance of 0.7 m has a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of about 0 dB (the background is as intense as the target talker Plomp 1977). 
This level is sufficient to give adequate intelligibility for listeners with normal hearing (Miller, 1947).

## Auditory scene analysis

- A critial role of the auditory system is to parse the inputs from the left and right ears into auditory objects - auditory scene analysis. This is an essential role for survival, recognition, and communication.

- Binaural hearing provides cues that allow us to estimate the relative number and location of sources and objects in the environment.

- These cues also help us to estimate the dimensions and characteristics of rooms as well as to hear out speakers in the presence of interfering noise.

## The role of spatial cues in Auditory scene analysis


>- When the speech sources are spatially separated, normal listeners can perceptually segregate and selectively attend to the source of interest if the sounds arrive from the same location - **spatial release from masking (SRM) ** (Freyman et al., 1999; Brungart, 2001; Freyman
et al., 2001; Hawley et al., 2004)


>- This task is extreamly challenging for listeners with sensorineural hearing loss (with or without hearing aids) or with cochlear implants (Loizou et al., 2009; Marrone et al., 2008).


>- Moreover, listeners with "normal" hearing and elder listeners experience great difficulty when listening in the presence of background noise (Ruggles et al., 2011; Swaminathan et al., 2015; Gallun et al., 2013).

>- Hearing impaired listeners with symmetric binaural hearing often demonstrate reduced SRM primarily due to increased thresholds in spatially separated conditions (Arbogast et al., 2005; Marrone et al., 2008b; Best et al., 2012)

## Hidden Hearing Loss

- Clinically, pure-tone audiometry (PTA) is used to assess the hearing status of human listeners (typically between 125 to
 8000Hz). However, some “Normal Hearing (NH)” listeners (5 - 15 % of patients) report great difficulties in understanding speech, particularly in noisy and high reverberation environments, beyond the level that would be predicted from their audiogram (Füllgrabe et al., 2015).
 
 
- Animal studies in mice and guinea pigs have shown that noise exposure can lead to 40 - 50 \% of loss of fibres synapses
 with the inner hair cells in the cochlea - **Synaptopathy** (e.g. Kujawa and Liberman, 2015, 2009; Liberman and Kujawa, 2014). 
- Histological data seems to confirm this effect in “Normal Hearing” human cochleas (Viana et al., 2015).

- Synaptopathy affect all types of AN fibers: high-SR \/ low- and medium-SR fibers ratio of about 1\:3 (Marmel et al. 2015). 
 
- Noise exposure may reduce the number of synapses between AN fibers and hair cells (Synaptopathy) but also induce **transient loss of cochlear Schwann cells resulting in permanent auditory temporal deficits (Wan and Corfas 2017)**

- Cochear synaptopathy reduces the ability to encode sound envelopes, specially at at higher inentensity levels.


## Which features are conveyed by speech sounds?

- Temporal fine structure (TFS)
- Envelope information (ENV)

## Binaural cues

When listening to sounds, we rely on three mechanisms for both sound localization and auditory scene analysis 

<li class ="fragment" data-fragment-index="0"> Interaural level differences (ILDs) </li>

<li class ="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"> Interaural time differences (ITDs) </li>

<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"> ILDs only useful for frequencies higher than 1200 Hz </li> 
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3"> ILDs can be as large as 20 dB (e.g. Bronkhorst &
Plomp, 1988) </li> 

<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">
ILDs resulting from the **head shadow** provide an advantage by sheltering the ear turned toward the target source from noise from the other side.
However, listeners with unilateral hearing loss struggle when the target sound comes from the impaired side, specially in the presence of background noise.
</li>

# Binaural processing and speech understanding

## Binaural Redundancy (aka Binarural summation)

- Loudness doubles when the two ears are used instead of one ear for a sound coming from the front of the listener (a single ear would require an increase of about 10 dB; Fletcher and Munson, 1933)

- Just noticeable differences in intensity and frequency improve with signal redundancy

- Speech recognition in the presence of background noise improves (Marrone 2008, Neher 2009)

- Hearing impairment may lead to a slightly weaker binaural benefit in patients  (Dillon, 2001)

- Binaural sounds can be louder than with a monaural presentation without causing discomfort (even true for CI-treated patient)

## Binaural hearing and hidden hearing loss

- Binaural hearing plays a critical role when listening speech in noise. 

- A deterioration in the ability to encode the temporal fine structure of speech will reduce the ability to encode ITD and speech understanding. 

- If noise exposure induces **transient loss of cochlear Schwann cells (Wan and Corfas 2017)**, the ability to encode ITD cues will decrease. 

- Processing of binaural stimuli is accomplished via an **"effective multiplication" of the neural information arising from each monaural channel** (Bernstein and Trahiotis2016). Thus, small monaural neural damage could result in more substantial and perceptually meaningful binaural losses.

## Interaural-phase Modulation Following Response (IPM-FR)

Objective measures of binaural processing can be obtained by using stimuli where the temporal fine structure is manipulated so that the perceived location of the sound image changes periodically (e.g. 6.7 Hz) over time.

##  Interaural-phase modulation

- The size of the interaural phase difference (relative ITD with respect to the frequency of the sound) will determine the lateralization of the sound.

## General Conclusions

- Interaural level and, in particular, interaural time differences conveyed by low frequencies (< 1500 Hz) are critical for speech understanding and segregation in the cocktail party problem (e.g. Swaminathan et al. 2016)

- Hearing-impaired listeners who typically find noisy environments disproportionately difficult for understanding speech, whether they wear a hearing aid or not (Killion 1997; Moore 1998).

- Similar problems are encountered by users of cochlear implants, again owing to the limited frequency resolution available with implants (Clark 2003).

- Binaural release from masking may improve detection thresholds up to 12 dB for multiple speech interferers (Jones and Litovsky, 2011), and facilitates source segregation provided that streaming can build up and natural onset cues are present (Drennan, Gatehouse, and Lever, 2003).

- Segregation is always better for the combination of both ITDs and ILDs cues (Culling, Hawley, and Litovsky 2004)

- Objective measures of binaural processing agree with difficulties to localize and understand speech in observed in hearing impaired and elder listeners.

- Objective and behavioural measures of binaural processing may be more sentitive than monaural measures to unveil hidden hearing loss.
